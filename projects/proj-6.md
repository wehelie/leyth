title: 'UdaciFeeds: Feed Reader Testing | Jasmine'
---

Used the red-green-refactor workflow to develop the UdaciFeeds project. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application included Jasmine, but with incomplete test suites. I completed all the required tests by:

- Validating opinions
- Identifying and defining expectations
- Writing expectations in code
