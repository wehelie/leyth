title: 'Neighborhood Map'
---

I developed a single-page application in KnockoutJS framework. The project features a map of my neighborhoodâ€™s parks and recreational centers utilizing google maps API. I added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list-view to support simple browsing of all locations. I also included the FourSquare API to pull important location data.
