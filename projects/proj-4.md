title: 'User Interface (UI)'
---

I, along with teammates, built a UI for a bookstore website. We were given a mockup of the UI along with their assests. For the first phase of this project, we were only allowed to use HTML and CSS, meaning, we were not expected to build the functional tabs interfaces. Hence, no JavaScript was added.
